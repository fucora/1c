# _TypeScript on JVM_

## What's 1c

1c is aimed to compile TypeScript to runnable code on both JVM and web browser. You can implement the full stack with TypeScript while using libraries from [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) together.

To make it clear, I'd like to quote from [sparkjava.com](http://sparkjava.com/):

> Lately, a lot of server-side web development has been taken over by NodeJS, but a growing number of NodeJS developers are using TypeScript and other statically typed languages that compile to JavaScript. Why not go all the way and use **a language that was actually designed with types**, and intended to run on the server-side? You also get all the **benefits of running your application on the JVM**, where libraries arenâ€™t deprecated every day.

Here is what 1c can offer: you can have TypeScript for the server-side and run it on the JVM.

Let's use [spark](http://sparkjava.com/) as an example.

1. Create `package.json` and run `1c install`

    ```typescript
    {
        "dependencies": {
            "@types/chalk": "^0.4.31",
            "chalk": "^1.1.3"
        },
        "mvnDependencies": [
            "com.sparkjava:spark-core:2.5.5",
            "org.slf4j:slf4j-simple:1.7.21"
        ]
    }
    ```

2. Create `main.ts`

    This is almost the same as the [Quick Start](http://sparkjava.com/) example of spark, except that it's going to print a green `Hello World` with the NPM library [chalk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chalk).

    ```typescript
    import { constructor as Chalk } from "chalk"

    const chalk = new Chalk({ enabled: true })
    const Spark = spark.Spark

    Spark.get("/hello", (req, res) => chalk.green("Hello World"))
    ```

3. Build and run

    ``` bash
    $ 1c build main.ts
    $ 1c run main.js
    [Thread-1] INFO org.eclipse.jetty.util.log - Logging initialized @1435ms
    [Thread-1] INFO spark.embeddedserver.jetty.EmbeddedJettyServer - == Spark has ignited ...
    [Thread-1] INFO spark.embeddedserver.jetty.EmbeddedJettyServer - >> Listening on 0.0.0.0:4567
    [Thread-1] INFO org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server - jetty-9.3.6.v20151106
    [Thread-1] INFO org.eclipse.jetty.server.ServerConnector - Started ServerConnector@78ce693d
    [Thread-1] INFO org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server - Started @1588ms
    ```

    You can use the command line to test it now.

    ```
    $ curl http://127.0.0.1:4567/hello
    ```
